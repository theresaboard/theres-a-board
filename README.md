# There's a Board

## Project Description

> An open source mentorship app initially designed around the simple idea of students teaching other students at Dev Bootcamp. There's a Board evolved into a powerful support platform allowing students, alumni, and employee mentors to connect for studying, tutoring, and skill development. There's a Board was adopted by Dev Bootcamp and is currently in use as their tool for managing both paid and volunteer mentors.


## Built With:

* Ruby/Rails for backend and API.
* JavaScript for custom front end (utilizing AJAX for API consumption).
* jQuery, FullCalendar, Bootstrap, for front end presentation and calendar interaction.
* Test Driven Development using Rspec.
* CircleCI and SimpleCov for continuous integration and coverage analysis.
* OmniAuth/Auth0 for OAuth integration.
* GitHub for version control.
* Heroku for continuous deployment.

## Directions:

> There's a Board was designed to be as frictionless for the user as possible. For this reason, we decided to setup login and user registration via your github account. Only github members with a DBC affiliated repository can log in successfully and use the site to keep membership strictly within the DBC community. To see the site in action, we have provided a walkthrough of the site.
